# GitCF

GitCF is a service that is similar to [RawGit](https://rawgit.com/), but this one is running on [CloudFlare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).

The source code of the script is located at [maple3142/gitcf](https://github.com/maple3142/gitcf), and you can simply copy and paste the script to Workers editor to get your own instance.

Currently, this is running on CloudFlare Workers' **Free** plan, so don't rely on this.
